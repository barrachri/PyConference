Broadly speaking, it is used by 4 sets of people / categories with overlapping responsibilities.\r\n\r\nComputer Graphics Engineers, Math, CS, Physics PhD\u2019s and others in similar positions undertake the responsibility of very low level research and development such as creation of \u2018shading\u2019 and \u2018rendering\u2019 solutions, implementation of physics simulation algorithms, etc. Their development efforts help create the core toolset artists utilize when creating visuals. They either extend the possibilities that existing 3D software packages offer (like Maya, 3DS Max, Houdini and more) or create entirely new tools.\r\n\r\nPipeline TD\u2019s and Engineers build and maintain the visual effects studio pipeline and help facilitate the production efficiently by managing the data-flow. This mainly involves building tools and plugins that interface with the 3D software packages that are in use or creating stand-alone desktop applications.\r\n\r\nTechnical Directors for each department address the particular needs of their departments by building scripts, tools, plugins \u2014 whatever the problem at hand requires. They usually interface with the tools that Engineers upstream build and with the 3D software packages that are already in use to achieve the solutions that they are after.\r\n\r\nEager Artists aka Budding Programmers are artists that are frustrated by the limitations of the toolset that they are given and devise automation solutions using the API of the software in use to build scripts and tools that helps with the redundant, repetitive, boilerplate tasks.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the software packages that are used in VFX nowadays have a Python API. Moreover programs are moving towards using PySide in implementing their visual interface, which further enables artists to utilize this toolkit to build their own GUI solutions \u2014 either integrated to the software or as a standalone desktop application.

Take a look at three different matplotlib tutorials, and chances are, you'll see at least two, if not three, different ways to interact with matplotlib! Understanding the correct way may not always be obvious. \r\n\r\nNow, fast forward past the basics. You've created a few visualizations with the aid of whatever tutorials you've found online, but you still don't feel like you have a good grip on how matplotlib works. You call the plot function several different ways and it seems to work just fine in the tutorials, but it doesn't seem to be doing what you want it to now. Oh, and not to mention, why do I need to call the show() function sometimes and not others? These are all the types of questions that I had when I was first learning matplotlib and it took a bit of work to find the answers to all of them. \r\n\r\n In this talk I cover everything that I wish I knew when I was first learning matplotlib.

Many times I've seen individuals, who have used matplotlib in the past, at a loss when they need to do something they've never done before.

Good development environments help us efficiently manage our workflow as we make code changes, and they can be adapted to fit a changing stack and team. In this talk, we\u2019ll look at shortcomings of different development environment solutions, and how we\u2019ve attempted to solve them with Python and Docker.\r\n\r\nThe simplest solution is to just run your app on the command line - for example with python my_app.py. This is easy and works well if your setup is simple.  But as you scale your stack, adding apps and developers, this approach becomes problematic.  When you have more than one app to run, you can run into dependency conflicts between apps.  When you add more developers, it becomes a challenge to reproduce your system configuration so that each app runs smoothly on each developer\u2019s machine. Virtualenvs help these issues by providing a measure of isolation and reproducibility.  However they only partly solve the problem; environment variables, system libraries, and other system configuration all hamper reproducibility and isolation.\r\n\r\nA common approach to these problems is to run code in a virtual machine.  This does increase the portability of an environment, but still comes with some issues.  Changing dependencies and configuration over time can prompt changes in the VM system state, which can create the same reproducibility issues as before.  Configuration management software can help, but comes with its own set of issues.  Additionally, virtual machines come with performance penalties; shared folders have poor performance, and the VM will consume tons of memory if you have a large stack.  Finally, apps running on the same VM can still suffer from lack of isolation. Conflicting system dependencies, apps that want to listen on the same port, and other issues will require workarounds.\r\n\r\nDocker containers provide an opportunity to improve on these shortcomings.  Containers are by nature isolated and portable, and they come without the performance overhead that\u2019s associated with virtual machines. However there are still problems to solve before containers can be managed easily in a development environment workflow. How are the containers launched in a reproducible way?  How are containers connected so that they can communicate as needed?  What happens when we need to make changes to the stack being run? We\u2019ve built a Python app which manages docker containers and abstracts these processes.  Dusty (dusty.gc.com) knows how to run an arbitrarily complex stack based on a set of defined specs, and provides other workflow management features.

In a High Performance Computing (HPC) environment, filesystem access is a bottleneck and temporary files should be avoided.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will show how a Python driver module and an in-memory filesystem (RAM disk) can be used to orchestrate the data flow between various tools without creating temporary files on disk and fully automate the entire process.\r\nExcept for the first input and the last output step, all file I/O is redirected to the RAM disk. The process can also be parallelized in the Python driver module by distributing different input files to different processes using Python multiprocessing.\r\nThe use of this technique leads to a speed-up of 800% compared to traditional methods, and requires no human intervention.\r\n\r\nDifferent input datasets are supported and new datasets can be added easily due to the object oriented implementation: at every stage of the pre-processing pipeline a dataset method can be overloaded and a different tool can be used, depending on the input dataset.\r\nThis would not have been possible in a simple scripting language that might otherwise be used to automate such a process.\r\n\r\nThis module (called PyWPS), is part of the WRF Tools package, a set of Python modules and shell scripts designed to facilitate the operation of a regional climate model (the Weather Research and Forecasting model - WRF) in a HPC environment. It is capable of autonomously running the model over extended periods of time (including automatic crash handling and restarts), automatic pre- and post-processing and archiving.\r\n\r\nIn the presentation I will first provide some context on regional climate modeling and its computational challenges, before detailing the main design features of the Python WRF pre-processing system (PyWPS).\r\n\r\nThe package is available on GitHub: https://github.com/aerler/WRF-Tools", "speaker": 25, "additional_speakers": [], "title": "Orchestrating a Climate Modeling Data Pipeline", "slot": 60, "cancelled": false}}, {"pk": 31, "model": "schedule.presentation", "fields": {"description": "Timekeeping is no easy business.
