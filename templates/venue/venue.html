                                Toronto has 2 major airports. Toronto Pearson is the international airport and is the
                                location for almost all the major domestic and international airlines. It's about a 35
                                minute drive from Toronto Pearson to the University of Toronto, but be aware that
                                downtown Toronto traffic is busy all day and is particularly busy during peak rush hour.
                                Allow at least an hour for travel time from the airport.
